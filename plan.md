## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process for Future Features

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering
- **Understand the Need**: Clearly articulate the problem or enhancement the new feature addresses.
- **Define Scope**: What exactly will the feature do? What won't it do (out of scope)?
- **Set Objectives**: What are the measurable goals for this feature? (e.g., "Reduce troubleshooting time by 10%").
- **Identify Stakeholders**: Who will use this feature? Who needs to approve it?
- **Gather Detailed Requirements**:
    - Functional Requirements: What inputs will it take? What outputs will it produce? What logic will it follow?
    - Non-Functional Requirements: Performance (how fast should it be?), Security (any new data handling?), Usability (ease of use), Reliability.
    - Data Source Identification: Identify the APIs (iLO, Orbit, Sirius) and data formats.
    - Success Criteria: How will you know if the feature is successful?

### Phase 2: Design
- **System Architecture Design**: How will the new feature integrate with the existing dashboard structure?
- **UI/UX Design**: Create wireframes or mockups.
- **Data Model Design**: Design new data structures.
- **API Integration Design**: Define API endpoints.

### Phase 3: Development
- **Modular Coding**: Organize code by function.
- **Incremental Development**: Build in small chunks.
- **Version Control**: Use Git, with frequent commits.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks.

### Phase 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify different system parts work together.
- **Functional Testing**: Ensure the feature meets requirements.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess the impact on speed.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Gather end-user feedback.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- **Deployment to Server**: Upload updated files.
- **Rollback Plan**: Revert to previous version if needed.

### Phase 6: Maintenance & Monitoring
- **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor the dashboard's performance.
- **Bug Fixing**: Address any issues.
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback and improve.
